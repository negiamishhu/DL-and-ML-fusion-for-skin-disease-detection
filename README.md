# DL-and-ML-fusion-for-skin-disease-detection
We have proposed hybrid models by combining deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) . Often DL models lack transparency in decision making and overfit in the case of small dataset, in contrast ML model alone do not perform well on skin lesion images due to significant variations in terms of lighting, angle, and resolution. In this  work we have strategically integrated DL (Mobilenet, VGG-16)models for feature extraction and then trained on efficient ML classifiers such as Random forest (RF), gradient boost (XG boost), to improve the class wise performances of the model.
